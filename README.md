AI-Inspired Student Performance & Academic Risk Analyzer

Type: Rule-Based Explainable Decision Support System
Skills Demonstrated: Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Rule-Based AI, Explainable Insights, Data Visualization (Matplotlib), Streamlit Web App

Project Overview:
This project is a fully explainable, AI-inspired system that analyzes student academic and behavioral data to identify students at risk, explain the causes, and provide actionable recommendations. Unlike black-box ML models, this system is rule-based and interpretable, making it practical for educational decision-making.
It converts raw data into Performance Index scores, risk levels, trend analysis, key insights, and recommendations, enabling proactive support for students.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handles missing values, outliers, and invalid ranges
Normalizes features (0–100 scale)
Derives meaningful scores: Study Discipline, Attendance, Academic Score, Performance Index
Performance Index
Aggregates multiple academic and behavioral metrics into a single interpretable score
Weighted formula ensures clear, explainable decision-making
Risk Classification
Rule-based classification: High Risk / Medium Risk / Low Risk
Transparent logic — easy to justify decisions
Trend Analysis
Monitors student performance over semesters
Labels trends as Improving, Stable, or Declining
Insight & Recommendation Engine
Identifies causes of academic risk: low attendance, poor study discipline, or academic weakness
Generates actionable recommendations for improvement
Final Reports & Interactive Dashboard
Streamlit dashboard for interactive filtering
